   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Scripting Quick Start
=====================

See README for installation. Toil's Job class contains the Toil API, documented below.
To begin, consider this short toil script:

.. code:: python

   from toil.job import Job
   from argparse import ArgumentParser
   import sys

   class HelloWorld(Job):
      def __init__(self):
         Job.__init__(self,  memory=100000, cores=2, disk=20000)
      def run(self, fileStore):
         fileId = fileStore.getEmptyFileStoreID()
         self.addChild(Job.wrapJobFn(childFn, fileId,
             cores=1, memory="1M", disk="10M"))
         self.addFollowOn(FollowOn(fileId))

   def childFn(target, fileID):
      with target.fileStore.updateGlobalFileStream(fileID) as file:
         file.write("Hello, World!")

   class FollowOn(Job):
      def __init__(self,fileId):
         Job.__init__(self)
         self.fileId=fileId
      def run(self, fileStore):
         tempDir = fileStore.getLocalTempDir()
         tempFilePath = "/".join([tempDir,"LocalCopy"])
         with fileStore.readGlobalFileStream(self.fileId) as globalFile:
            with open(tempFilePath, "w") as localFile:
               localFile.write(globalFile.read())

   def main():
       parser = ArgumentParser()
       Job.Runner.addToilOptions(parser)
       options = parser.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])
       Job.Runner.startToil(HelloWorld(),  options)

   if __name__=="__main__":
       main()

The script consists of three Jobs - the object based HelloWorld and FollowOn Jobs,
and the function based childFn Job. The object based Jobs inherit from the Job class,
and must invoke the Job constructor and implement the run method, where the user's code
to be executed should be placed.

Note that the constructor takes optional resource parameters, which specify the cores,
memory, and disk space needed for the job to run successfully. These resources can be
specified in bytes, or by passing in a string as in the constructor for the wrapJobFn().

Also notice the two types of descendant Jobs. HelloWorld specifies childFn as a child Job,
and FollowOn as a follow on Job. The only difference between a parent, children, and a
follow on is the order of execution. Parents are executed first, its children, finally
followed by the follow ons. The children and follow on jobs are run in parallel.
